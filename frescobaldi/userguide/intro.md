=== Introduction ===

[http://lilypond.org LilyPond] is a Free Software music engraving program,
producing very high-quality sheet music printouts from fairly simple text input
files.
Input files can be created using virtually any text editor, which LilyPond 
can then compile and output beautiful engraving, by default but not restricted
to, PDF.

Frescobaldi is an application designed to make editing LilyPond music scores
faster and easier. You will still need to learn LilyPond's input language
but if you read the {getting_started} section of this User Guide, you'll pickup
some LilyPond basics to get you started.

Once you have grasped the basics, the next step would be to use the LilyPond 
Learning Manual from 
[http://lilypond.org/doc/ LilyPond's excellent online documentation].
