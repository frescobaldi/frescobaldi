=== Mode shift ===

Use the mode shifter to change all or selected notes to a specified mode or scale. 
Any note that is divergent will be adjusted to fit inside the given mode/scale.

In the dialog enter the key (root/tonic pitch) as a note name in your preferred 
language. And choose the mode/scale in the dropdown list. 

*Note that unlike the modal transposer all pitches will be shifted to the chosen 
scale regardless of which mode they possibly belonged to originally.*

*Note also that when using modes with less than seven scale steps (e. g. 
hexatonic and pentatonic modes) the mode shift can lead to double notes.*
