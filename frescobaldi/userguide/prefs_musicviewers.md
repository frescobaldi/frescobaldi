=== Music View Preferences ===

Under *Music View* preferences you can configure how music is
displayed and printed.
This is where PDF files are displayed and all the settings
discussed here refer to PDF files only (SVG files have a
different viewer).

= Documents =

The *Documents* sections contains two main settings.

*Only load updated PDF documents*: if checked, when you
open a LilyPond source file you won't see the PDF document
in the viewer if it's not up-to-date (i.e. the PDF file is
older than the source file). If unchecked, PDF file will
be opened regardless.

*Remember View settings per-document*: if checked, every
document in the Music View will remember its own scale
and layout settings instead of the default ones (see
next section).

= Page scaling, layout and scrolling =

Here you can define the default scaling and layout of
the document. These preferences may be ignored for
the documents where different settings have been set,
if the option *Remember View settings per-document* is
checked.


= Printing =

Here you can set the resolution to be sent to the printer
when using the Frescobaldi print dialog.
The closest resolution supported by your printer will be
used. If unsure, leave the default value.
