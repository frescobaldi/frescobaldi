=== Music Preferences ===

Here you can configure how music is displayed and printed.

You can configure whether to use the Arthur backend for music display and
printing. For display it is not yet recommended, as the default Splash raster
engine is more robust, but for printing Arthur is recommended, as it is
vector-based rather than raster-based, which significantly improves printing
quality.

On systems that use the CUPS server, such as macOS and GNU/Linux, PDF's
can be sent directly to the printer if you want to.

The print resolution is only used when raster-based printing can't be avoided.
