=== The Quick Insert Panel ===

With the tools in the Quick Insert Panel you can add various music elements
to the current note or selected music.

The *Direction* chooser specifies if articulations, dynamics or slurs
appear in a neutral position (e.g. determined by stem direction), or above
or below the staff by prepending a `-`, `^` or `_` character.

Click on a tab to select a tool. You can cycle through the tools with Ctrl
(or {command}) and the mouse wheel.
All buttons in the Quick Insert Panel have configurable keyboard shortcuts;
you can change them by right-clicking a button.


== Articulations ==

These musical symbols can be added to a note or rest or a selected range
of music.
If you add them to a selection, rests will be skipped.
If there is no text selected, the cursor will automatically move to the next
pitch, rest, skip or chord.

If *Allow shorthands* is checked, Frescobaldi will use short signs
for articulations if they exist
(e.g. `-.` instead of `-\staccato`).


== Dynamics ==

Dynamics can also be added to a note or rest.
If you select a range of music, you can add spanners which will automatically
terminate at the last note, rest or chord in the selection.
If you then click a sign, it will replace the terminator.


== Spanners ==

This tool lets you add arpeggio, glissandos and other spanners like slurs,
phrasing slurs, manual beams or trills.

Arpeggios and glissandos apply to the current note;
they need no music to be selected.
The slurs, beams or trill apply to the current note and the next one
if no music is selected,
or to the first and the last note or chord in the selection.


== Bar Lines ==

Here you can insert bar lines or various breathing signs.
