=== Importing and exporting snippets ===
    
Snippets can be imported from and exported to XML files.

To export snippets, either select them in the snippet manager, or filter the 
snippets using the search bar and select none, so that all the snippets 
visible in the snippet manager are exported. Export the snippets by 
selecting {menu_export}, and then choose a file name, preferably ending in 
`.xml`.

To import snippets, select {menu_import} and choose the file you want to 
import. You may also drop an XML file on the snippet manager. A dialog will 
be displayed where you can select which snippets you want to import.

The XML format of the snippet library files is simple and documented inside 
the XML file.
