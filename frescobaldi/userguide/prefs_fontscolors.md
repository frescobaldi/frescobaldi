=== Fonts & Colors ===
    
Here you can set the editor font (a monospace font is recommended) and all 
colors.

The first item lets you set the colors for the text editor background, 
foreground, selection background, the current line, line markings, the paper 
color in the Music View, etcetera.

The second item lets you set color and other attributes of the general 
highlighting styles, e.g. keyword, variable, value, comment, etcetera.

The other items contain the types of text the syntax highlighter recognizes 
for every particular document type Frescobaldi supports. Some of these types 
inherit a general style. It is possible to set the attributes bold, italic, 
underline and the foreground, background and underline color.

You can define a new scheme by using the New button.
