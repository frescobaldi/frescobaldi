=== Music View ===

The Music View displays the PDF document created by LilyPond.

When LilyPond was run in preview mode (i.e. with Point & Click turned on), 
the PDF contains a clickable link for every music object, pointing to its 
definition in the text document.

The Music View uses this information to provide smart, two-way integration 
with the text document:

* Move the mouse pointer over music objects to highlight them in the text
* Click an object to move the text cursor to that object
* Shift-click an object to edit its text in a small window (see 
  {musicview_editinplace})
* Move the text cursor to highlight them in the music view, press
  {key_music_jump_to_cursor} to scroll them into view.

You can also adjust the view:

* Use the Control (or Command) key with the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
* Hold Control or Command and left-click to display a magnifier glass
* Configure the background color under {settings_preview_background}

You can copy music right from the PDF view to a raster image: use the right
mouse button to drag a rectangular selection, then press
{key_music_copy_image} or select {menu_music_copy_image} to copy the 
selected music as a raster image to the clipboard, a file or another 
application.
