Abstract base for viewer widgets
"""

from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QWidget


class AbstractViewWidget(QWidget):
    """Widget containing an abstract viewer widget."""
    pass

    # This serves as a stub for a future base class.
    # It will have to contain the complete interface for generic viewer
    # widgets and any implementation that is not specific to the viewer's
    # technology (Poppler/QWebView or whatever).
    #
    # The idea is to have a consistent interface (with regard to toolbar,
    # navigation, contextmenu etc.) throughout all viewers
    #
    # Currently all code is in AbstractPopplerWidget, but we will have to
    # move as much as possible up to the current base class ASAP.
