This Finnish hyphenation dictionary for the ALTLinux LibHnj library
was converted in 2003-11-03 by Jarno Elonen <elonen@iki.fi>
from TeX hyphenation patterns in "fihyph.tex" as described at
http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/hyphenator.html.

Here are the acknowledgements from the original pattern
file:

  First release January -86 by Kauko Saarinen,
  Computing Centre, University of Jyvaskyla, Finland

  Completely rewritten January -88. The new patterns make
  much less mistakes with foreign and compound words.
  The article "Automatic Hyphenation of Finnish"
  by Professor Fred Karlsson is also referred

  8th March -89 (vers. 2.2), some vowel triples by Fred Karlsson added.
  9th January - 95: added \uccode and \lccode by Thomas Esser

  Patterns may be freely distributed
