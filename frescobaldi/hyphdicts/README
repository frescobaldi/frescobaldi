These hyphenation dictionaries are taken from the openoffice.org-
hyphenation package, including their licensing information.

Linux distribution packagers may remove all *.dic and README* files and make
Frescobaldi depend instead on a package that installs hyphenation dictionaries
in /usr/share/hyphen. (See also the INSTALL.md file.)
