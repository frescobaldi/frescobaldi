# Installation instructions for Frescobaldi


## Using a pre-built package

Each release comes with installers for Windows and macOS.  These are available
from

https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/releases/

This is the simplest way of installing Frescobaldi under Windows or macOS.

Under Linux, your distribution probably provides a `frescobaldi` package.  If
so, installing it is the easiest route, even though it might be out of date.
Run `sudo apt install frescobaldi` on Debian/Ubuntu or `sudo dnf install
frescobaldi` on Fedora.

You can also install Frescobaldi from Flathub using Flatpak to get a more
up-to-date application.

https://flathub.org/apps/org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi

If you previously installed Frescobaldi via your distribution, remember to
remove it before installing it through Flatpak. Otherwise, they will coexist on
your computer; while this is not a problem per se, you could get the old
Frescobaldi version when you launch Frescobaldi graphically.



## Developing Frescobaldi

If you would like to help with the development of Frescobaldi, a Linux platform
is recommended. You will need install it from source in editable
mode. Frescobaldi is closely tied to two companion modules, python-ly and
qpageview; you might want to modify these too, so it is recommended to install
them from source as well.

### Uninstalling other versions

While not required, it is a good idea to save yourself confusion in the future
by uninstalling other versions of Frescobaldi. For example, `sudo apt remove
frescobaldi` if you installed via the system package on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo dnf
remove frescobaldi` on Fedora, or `flatpak remove org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi`
if you installed it via Flatpak, or `pip uninstall frescobaldi python-ly
qpageview` if you used pip, or `pipx uninstall frescobaldi` if you used pipx.

### Getting basic requirements

Frescobaldi is written in Python 3, so you will need a Python interpreter.  Most
Linux distributions come with Python 3 preinstalled.  Make sure that `python
--version` works.

You will also need a few packages from your operating system:

* [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx), for the installation process,
* [tox](https://tox.wiki), for orchestrating the build of autogenerated files,
* Git, the version control software used for Frescobaldi's source code,
* GNU Gettext, a suite of tools for working with translations, for generating
  compiled MO catalogs.
* [PortMidi](https://github.com/PortMidi/portmidi), for MIDI playback.

On Debian/Ubuntu, these packages can be installed using:

```
sudo apt install pipx tox git gettext libportmidi0
```

On Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install pipx tox git gettext portmidi
```

PyQt6 dependencies will be automatically installed from PyPI
when you install Frescobaldi.


### Getting the source code

Create a directory where you will store the Frescobaldi sources and
`cd` into it.  For example:

```
mkdir frescobaldi-repositories
cd frescobaldi-repositories
```

Next, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi.git
```

### Creating autogenerated files

The following commands generate `.mo` files for translations, and a desktop
file.

```
cd frescobaldi
tox -e mo-generate
tox -e linux-generate
cd ..
```

### Installing Frescobaldi

Install from source with `pipx`:

```
pipx install --editable ./frescobaldi
```

The `--editable` option makes sure that your changes to the source code will be
reflected.

pipx will install also the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
You can see the installed packages in
`~/.local/share/pipx/venvs/frescobaldi/lib/python3.XY/site-packages`.

After this command, you should be able to run Frescobaldi from source by running
`frescobaldi`.

### Installing the desktop file

The desktop file is what enabled you to run Frescobaldi as a normal application,
by clicking on an icon, instead of running Frescobaldi in a terminal. Install it
using

```
cd frescobaldi
desktop-file-install --dir ~/.local/share/applications/ --set-icon $PWD/frescobaldi/icons/org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi.svg  linux/org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/
cd ..
```

After waiting a few seconds, you should find a Frescobaldi application on your
system.

### Optional: installing python-ly and qpageview as editable

You now have a copy of Frescobaldi's source code that you can edit and launch
easily. However, Frescobaldi relies on two companion modules, python-ly and
qpageview, which you may want to develop as well. If you want to be able to
develop them, clone their sources:

```
git clone https://github.com/frescobaldi/python-ly.git
git clone https://github.com/frescobaldi/qpageview.git
```

then "inject" them into the already installed application so that they replace
the automatically downloaded copies of python-ly and qpageview:

```
pipx inject --editable frescobaldi ./python-ly ./qpageview
```

### Optional: additional features

Finally, you may want to install some optional modules that are needed
for certain features.

* If you want to print PDFs to a local CUPS server, also install `pycups` using
  `pipx inject frescobaldi pycups`.


## For Linux distribution packagers

See above for the dependencies that need to be installed.

Please note that a few files should be manually copied to the
proper system directories for the installation to work correctly:

| File type | File name                       | Installation directory |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Icon      | org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi.svg | /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps |
| Desktop   | org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi.desktop | /usr/share/applications |
| Metainfo  | org.frescobaldi.Frescobaldi.metainfo.xml | /usr/share/metainfo |

Frescobaldi contains some files by default which are also available in other
packages often used in Linux distributions. It is possible to remove those
files after installing/packaging and make Frescobaldi depend on the package
containing those files. This makes the filesystem less cluttered, and copyright
files simpler.

Icons:
You can remove the frescobaldi/icons/Tango directory, and make Frescobaldi
depend on the tango-icon-theme package instead.

Hyphenation dictionaries:
You can remove the hyph_*.dic files from frescobaldi/hyphdicts, and make
Frescobaldi depend on a package that installs hyphenation dictionaries in
/usr/share/hyphen/ (or another dictionary listed by default in frescobaldi/
hyphendialog.py). Do not remove the hyphdicts directory entirely.
