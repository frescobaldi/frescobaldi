README for Frescobaldi
======================

## Note about maintenance

Frescobaldi is unfortunately close to being unmaintained at present. Releases are extremely
difficult to do due to deep packaging issues especially on macOS
([issues with the macOS label](https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/labels/macOS))
and Frescobaldi is still using PyQt5, which is now obsolete
([#1407](https://github.com/frescobaldi/frescobaldi/issues/1407)).
Help to resolve these issues and continue the development of Frescobaldi is very welcome.

Frescobaldi is designed to run on all major operating systems (Linux, macOS
and Windows). It is named after Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643), an Italian
composer of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque period.

Here is an idea of the basic Frescobaldi workflow:

- Start Frescobaldi
- Open a .ly file or create one using *File->New* from template or
  *Tools->Setup new Score...* and fill in some music
- Press Ctrl+M to run LilyPond
- If the LilyPond output shows errors, press Ctrl+E to jump to the first error
- If you see other mistakes in the music, click the notes to move the text
  cursor there
- Fix the errors or mistakes in the text
- Press Ctrl+M again to update the music view
- When a piece is finished, press Ctrl+Shift+P once to run LilyPond with point
  and click turned off (this results in a much smaller PDF file).

Frescobaldi is written in Python and uses PyQt for its user interface.
