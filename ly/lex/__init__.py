r"""
This module is built on top of slexer and can parse LilyPond input and other
formats.

The base functionality is delegated to modules with an underscore in this package.
The modules describing parsing modes (filetypes) are the files without underscore.

Currently available are modes for lilypond, latex, html, texinfo, scheme, and docbook.

The 'underscored' modules should not be imported in application code. What is
needed from them is available here, in the ly.lex namespace.

If you add new files for parsing other file types, you should add them in _mode.py.
The _token.py module contains base Token types and Token mixin classes.

The State, Parser, FallthroughParser and Fridge classes from slexer are all
slightly extended here,

Usage::

    >>> import ly.lex
    >>> txt = r"\relative c' { c d e f-^ g }"
    >>> s = ly.lex.state("lilypond")
    >>> for t in s.tokens(txt):
    ...     print(t, t.__class__.__name__)
    \relative Command
      Space
    c Name
    ' Unparsed
      Space
    { SequentialStart
      Space
    c Note
      Space
    d Note
      Space
    e Note
      Space
    f Note
    - Direction
    ^ ScriptAbbreviation
      Space
    g Note
      Space
    } SequentialEnd

A State() is used to parse text. The text is given to the tokens() method, that
returns an iterator iterating over Token instances as they are found. Each token
has a 'pos' and an 'end' attribute describing its position in the original
string.

While iterating over the tokens(), the State maintains information about what
kind of text is parsed. (So don't iterate over more than one call to tokens() of
the same State object at the same time.)

Use ly.lex.state("name") to get a state for a specific mode to start parsing with.
If you don't know the type of text, you can use ly.lex.guessState(text), where
text is the text you want to parse. A quick heuristic is then used to determine
the type of the text.

See for more information the documentation of the slexer module.
