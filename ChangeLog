ChangeLog of Frescobaldi, http://www.frescobaldi.org/
=====================================================


Changes in 2.18 -- 

* Note about installing and for packagers/distributors:
  - the ly module that used to be in frescobaldi_app is now a separate package.
    It is listed among the dependencies in the INSTALL file and it can be found
    at https://github.com/wbsoft/python-ly and should be installed so that
    Frescobaldi can run.  
    When overwriting previous Frescobaldi installations, be sure that any
    remnants from the old ly package are removed, with a command like:
        rm -r /usr/local/<python site-packagesdir>/frescobaldi_app/ly
    Otherwise, Frescobaldi won't find the new ly module.
  - Frescobaldi now supports Python 3.2 and higher. Also 2.7 is still supported.
* New features:
  - Midi import, using the LilyPond-provided midi2ly tool
  - ABC import, using the LilyPond-provided abc2ly tool
  - In the Editor Preferences, you can select which quotes will be used as
    single and double (primary and secondary) typographical quotes (issue #529)
  - The music view now can display a PDF document with two pages next to each
    other, starting with a right or left page, and in single pages (issue #575)
  - A new pitch tool, Mode shift, which can be used to change all or selected 
    notes to a specified mode or scale.
* Improvements:
  - The Insert menu got renamed to Snippets, making more clear how it is used
    and can be changed. When copying text to a new snippet, the snippet is added
    to the menu by default, but the user can change that while editing.
  - Ctrl+Break (LilyPond → Abort Engraving Job) also stops an autocompile job
    if one is running.
  - The SVG View now displays a default gray background when no document is
    loaded, which is more helpful than a white background.
  - When right-clicking in the editor, the editor does not scroll anymore to
    show more surrounding lines.
  - Multi-line block comments are now also foldable (issue #587)
  - The magnifying glass in the Music View does not clip to the page borders
    anymore, which was annoying when showing many pages in a small size.
  - To save space in the toolbar, the almost never used Save As... button was
    removed. But when holding the Save button longer, three choices pop up:
    Save, Save As and Save All.
  - Ctrl-Mousewheel zooming the LilyPond Log now works properly.
* Bugfixes:
  - The german ("deutsch") pitch names asas and heses are now handled correctly.
    Previously, when translating the "nederlands" beses to german, it was output
    as bes, instead of heses. Same for "norsk" and "suomi" (issue #415)
  - If the preference "Open default viewer after successful compile" is enabled,
    the viewer to be opened is determined from the actual results, instead of
    the default output format. This fixes the PDF view opening instead of the
    SVG view, when the SVG format was chosen in the Engrave Custom dialog.
  - fix AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'insert' (issue #543)
  - the transpose functions will not transpose the chord after \stringTuning
    anymore (issue #539).
  - fix error when opening a "recent file" that has been deleted (issue #597)
* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr, ru

Changes in 2.17 -- December 26th, 2014

* New features:
  - Preference for the number of contextual lines to show at least, when the
    text view is scrolled to a cursor position (e.g. by clicking on a link, or
    when jumping between search results. Wish: issue #488)
  - Session import/export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr
  - A session can have its own list of include paths, that can be used either
    instead of or in addition to the global list of include paths, contributed
    by Peter Bjuhr
  - Relative mode for MIDI input, contributed by Alex Schreiber (pull request
    #521)
* Improvements:
  - When saving a new file for the first time, a default filename is provided,
    based on composer and title of the score (wish: issue #472)
  - Printing the music PDF now honors the duplex settings
  - MusicXML export has improved by using the ly.music module that has a notion
    of the music events and time/duration of those events. Although ly.music is
    authored and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen, the MusicXML export module is
    contributed by Peter Bjuhr
  - workaround a LilyPond buglet in point-and-click highlighting of quoted
    strings: although the textedit uri points to the closing quote, the string
    is correctly highlighted
  - dont disable run button of Engrave Custom dialog for autocompile jobs
  - let autocompile jobs finish before starting a new one (comments issue #120)
  - dont always run autocompile job for the first opened document
  - after a successful compile the default music viewer (pdf or svg) is
    activated. This can be suppressed in the LilyPond prefs (wish: issue #435)

    but the user is working on a different document (wish: issue #513)
  - tooltips for the panel title and float/close buttons
  - error handling in I/O-related operations has improved
  - Ctrl+C in editor view does not copy HTML, only plain text (issue #517)
  - Features that are in development can be enabled by checking Preferences→
    General→Experimental Features→Enable Experimental Features. Some features
    that are not completely finished are hidden by default but become visible
    when this preference is enabled. New features are enabled after a restart,
    or when a new main window is created using Window→New.
* Bugfixes:
  - fix AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'endswith' in
    lilypondinfo.py, toolcommand()

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr, it
* New features
  - preference to automatically strip trailing whitespace on save (issue #274)

  - new option to copy only the styled HTML contents to the clipboard
    wrapped in a pre tag, not a full HTML document

  - LilyPond instance can be selected in convert-ly dialog (wish #311)
  - Score Wizard: In the midi section the \tempo x=y syntax is now used when

  - Score Wizard: new brass instruments contributed by Ryan Michael McClure
  - in the builtin manual, if there is no "Next:" page, add a link to the next
    page of the first parent page that has a next page. The link is called
    "Next Chapter:" and allows for continuous reading of the manual.
  - some missing commands and functions were added to highlighting and
    autocompletion
  - the Document Fonts snippet doesn't require setting the staffize anymore
  - View -> Folding -> Fold all now folds all subregions as well, making
    gradual unfolding easier (wish #394)
* Bugfixes:
  - fix sticky document setting lost on reload (issue #409)
  - fix html export and copy not using the correct color scheme

    selected music

    syntax in LilyPond 2.18, such as \hide, \omit, \undo, \override, \tweak,
    \accidentalStyle, etc.
  - New editor option to wrap lines in the editor view to avoid horizontal
    scrolling (wish #45)
  - Custom engrave: the anti-alias-factor can be set in the dialog (wish #361)
  - on Mac OS X the applications remains active when all main windows are
    closed. This is expected behaviour on Mac OS X.
  - New builtin snippet, linked to Ctrl+D by default, to double the current
    line or selection (issue #340)
  - A new preference for new documents: whether a new document is created empty,
    with the preferred LilyPond version in it, or using a template from the
    snippets list
  - New menu command: LilyPond->Show available fonts (wish #341)
  - Music View: rendering in small sizes has been improved
* Improvements:
  - In the score wizard it is possible to enter a custom string tuning for the
    plucked string instruments, and the Ukulele is added (issue #342)
  - In the score wizard you can enable Smart neutral stem direction, which adds
    the Melody_engraver to the Voice context, resulting in a logical direction
    for notes on the middle staff line (issue #371)
  - Print source, Copy colored HTML and Export source as colored HTML: add line
    numbers if enabled in the preferences.
  - In the Editor preferences, it is adjustable whether HTML export or copy use
    a stylesheet or inline style attributes.
  - It is now possible to copy syntax-highlighted HTML as plain text to the
    clipboard, by enabling the preference setting.
  - MIDI input: add key signature alterations mapping, by Olivier Samyn
  - New barline types in the Quick Insert panel, the barlines are written
    in the correct style, depending on the LilyPond version set in the document
    (issue #365).
  - In the output-suffix (the scheme output-suffix variable or 
    \bookOutputSuffix), non-alphanumeric characters (except '-' and '_') are 
    replaced with '_', just like LilyPond itself does it (issue #373).
* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed issue 336: TypeError on MusicXml export
  - Fixed error message when exporting keyboard shortcuts on platforms that do
    not have the HOME environment variable set
  - Fixed IndexError when transposed notes would get unexisting alterations,
    e.g. when a cis is transposed from c to cisis. The note is then altered,
    just like LilyPond handles this.
* Temporarily removed feature:
  - MusicXML export has been temporarily removed from the File->Export menu. 
    It is still visible in the git checkout. It is also available in the ly 
    command (in the python-ly package, and also in Frescobaldi's git checkout) 
    but it needs more testing and robustness before it is usable in Frescobaldi.


Changes in 2.0.13 -- December 31st, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr
* New features:
  - A new option LilyPond->Auto-engrave, that runs the engraver in preview mode
    everytime the document changes
  - An option to hide log display for automatically started engraving jobs
  - Real-time Midi capturing, contributed by Manuel Mchalwat (this was actually
    in 2.0.12, I just forgot to write it in the ChangeLog!)
  - Basic MusicXML export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr (this was also already
    added in Frescobaldi 2.0.12)
  - The "master" variable is back, allbeit in a slightly different
    implementation: the redirected filename is not directly given to a LilyPond
    process running on behalf of the current document, but the other document
    is loaded (if it wasn't already) and LilyPond is run on that document.
* Bug fixes:
  - Fix UnboundLocalError in ly.docinfo e.g. when showing the Tools->Pitch->
    Language menu
  - Fix issue 332: Cursor didn't move on undo/redo
  - Fix issue 315: chords: \include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
    (the file was added, but the include files weren't written in the document)


Changes in 2.0.12 -- December 26th, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: cs, nl, fr, es
* New features:
  - Edit->Select Block has finally been implemented
  - A viewer for LilyPond-generated SVG files has been added by Peter Bjuhr. 
    This viewer (accessible via Tools->SVG Viewer) currently has one-way point 
    and click. This only works with recent development versions of LilyPond, 
    that add the point and click information to SVG files. In the future, the
    SVG view may become a fully fledged graphical music editor.
  - The default output format can be set in the LilyPond preferences (the 
    current options are PDF or SVG, the default is PDF)
* Improvements:
  - The indenter's handling of tabs and spaces has been improved. A tab always
    starts a new indent level, and aligning is now always done with spaces.
    The default is still using 2 spaces for indent, but it is now configurable
    in a new settings panel Editor Preferences.
  - Besides the good old Preview and Publish modes a new mode has been added:
    Layout Control. This mode uses the settings on the preview mode panel, which
    has been renamed to Layout Control Options. The layout of the panel has been
    improved. The Preview mode is reverted back to enabling only point and click
    links. In the Engrave (custom) dialog the run mode can be chosen and the
    commandline edited directly.
  - Entering staccatissimo writes -! when the document specifies a LilyPond
    version >= 2.17.25, otherwise -|
  - When editing keyboard shortcuts, conflicts are directly shown as they are
    entered; better support French keyboards (contributed by Nicolas Malarmey)
  - Better Mac OS X icons (contributed by Davide Liessi)
  - The internal handling of manipulations like transpose, translate, and the
    various rhythm commands has become less dependent on Frescobaldi code.
    These functionality now resides in the ly module and could be used by 
    other applications. The commands now can work on any ly.document, which 
    need not be a Frescobaldi document.
  - The internal help system has seen a massive overhaul: help files are now
    very easy to write in a simplified markdown-like syntax. Adding help pages
    is very easy by dropping a *.md file in the userguide/ directory. Every
    paragraph in a help file is automatically added to the POT file and can be
    translated by editing the language's PO file.
* Bug fixes:
  - Music View: horizontal scrolling using trackpad now works with kinetic mode
    enabled. Fixes #248.
* Removed feature:
  - The 'master' variable is no longer supported, it's goal has been superseded
    by the 'Always Engrave' option, which is also saved in the session. This
    decision was taken to simplify the handling of files created on behalf of
    a document.

  - New actions to remove articulations etc. from music (wish #180)
  - Edit->Copy to Snippet, to copy the selection or the full document
    contents to a new snippet
* Improvements:
  - highlighting and auto-completion of Scheme code has been improved
    by Nicolas Malarmey. 
  - when switching documents with multiple editor views open, and one of the
    views displays the document, that view is made current, instead of changing
    the document in the current view.
  - the tempo-tapping button in the score wizard now uses the average clicking
    speed instead of computing the bpm at each click (implementing wish #169)
  - under the File menu there is also a New with Wizard... action calling the
    score wizard, creating a new document when clicking Ok, contributed by Urs
    Liska
  - Word-related cursor movements have been improved. The backslash is now
    considered a word boundary, even if there are no spaces between several
    backslashed commands. Fixes wish #106.
* Bug fixes:
  - various fixes and improvements on Mac OS X by Davide Liessi
  - fix splash screen shown as grey rectangle on some systems
  - in the LilyPond log, clicking on error mesages in files with '..' in their
    path (happens when using e.g. \include "../blabla.ly") now works.

    a red background in the document chooser. See Preferences->Tools->Music View

    re-checks for updated PDF documents. If there are no updated PDFs it even
    tries to load non up-to-date PDFs (regardless of the setting above)

  - New actions View->Matching Pair and Select Matching Pair to jump to or

    take a long time anymore when editing or moving through a long document
  - string numbers are highlighted (and understood) correctly outside chords

  - Export colored HTML now uses CSS classes, makes it easy to change the high-
    lighting in the HTML later (idea: issue #89)

  - Fix hyphenation of words with accents (reported by Andreas Edlund)
  - Fix Save As... on Mac OS X (issue #104)
  - Fix startup failure on Mac OS X (issue #77)
