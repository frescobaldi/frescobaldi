=====================================================


Changes in 2.0.16 -- 

* Translations:
  - updated: nl
* New features
  - preference to automatically strip trailing whitespace on save (issue #274)
  - in Tools -> Rhythm: new command to remove duration scalings that contain 
    a fraction value (the action was already available for some time, but it 
    wasn't in the menu)
  - new option to copy only the styled HTML contents to the clipboard
    wrapped in a pre tag, not a full HTML document
* Improvements:
  - jumps in the Document Outline also allow navigating back
  - autocompile does only happen when a document has toplevel markup or music

    LilyPond version >= 2.16 is used (issue #337)
  - in the builtin manual, if there is no "Next:" page, add a link to the next
    page of the first parent page that has a next page. The link is called
    "Next Chapter:" and allows for continuous reading of the manual.
  - some missing commands and functions were added to highlighting and
    autocompletion
  - the Document Fonts snippet doesn't require setting the staffize anymore
  - View -> Folding -> Fold all now folds all subregions as well, making

  - fix AttributeError in handle_lyricmode while typing \lyricmode
  - fix LilyPond version chooser not defaulting to the default LilyPond version
  - fix indenter aligning on comment
  - fix AttributeError: QStackedWidget object has no attribute cursorForPosition
    on doubleclick in the text, reported by an Apple user


Changes in 2.0.15 -- March 11th, 2014

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr
* New features:
  - in context menu: Jump to definition (wish #123)
  - in View menu: view file or definition at cursor, combines the old
    File->Open File at Cursor action with the new Jump to definition action
  - new toolbar buttons to browse back after a jump to definition
* Improvements:
  - better highlighting of figuremode
* Bugfixes:
  - fix ValueError message when typing << >> or \partcombine
  - fix IndexError when typing 'variable ='


Changes in 2.0.14 -- March 7th, 2014

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr
* New features:
  - the status bar now shows the position in the music or the length of the
    selected music
  - highlighting and auto-completion for commands that are new or have changed
    syntax in LilyPond 2.18, such as \hide, \omit, \undo, \override, \tweak,
    \accidentalStyle, etc.
  - New editor option to wrap lines in the editor view to avoid horizontal
    scrolling (wish #45)
  - Custom engrave: the anti-alias-factor can be set in the dialog (wish #361)
  - on Mac OS X the applications remains active when all main windows are
    closed. This is expected behaviour on Mac OS X.
  - New builtin snippet, linked to Ctrl+D by default, to double the current
    line or selection (issue #340)
  - A new preference for new documents: whether a new document is created empty,
    with the preferred LilyPond version in it, or using a template from the
    snippets list
  - New menu command: LilyPond->Show available fonts (wish #341)
  - Music View: rendering in small sizes has been improved
* Improvements:
  - In the score wizard it is possible to enter a custom string tuning for the
    plucked string instruments, and the Ukulele is added (issue #342)
  - In the score wizard you can enable Smart neutral stem direction, which adds
    the Melody_engraver to the Voice context, resulting in a logical direction
    for notes on the middle staff line (issue #371)
  - Print source, Copy colored HTML and Export source as colored HTML: add line
    numbers if enabled in the preferences.
  - In the Editor preferences, it is adjustable whether HTML export or copy use
    a stylesheet or inline style attributes.
  - It is now possible to copy syntax-highlighted HTML as plain text to the
    clipboard, by enabling the preference setting.
  - MIDI input: add key signature alterations mapping, by Olivier Samyn
  - New barline types in the Quick Insert panel, the barlines are written
    in the correct style, depending on the LilyPond version set in the document
    (issue #365).
  - In the output-suffix (the scheme output-suffix variable or 
    \bookOutputSuffix), non-alphanumeric characters (except '-' and '_') are 
    replaced with '_', just like LilyPond itself does it (issue #373).
* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed issue 336: TypeError on MusicXml export
  - Fixed error message when exporting keyboard shortcuts on platforms that do
    not have the HOME environment variable set
  - Fixed IndexError when transposed notes would get unexisting alterations,
    e.g. when a cis is transposed from c to cisis. The note is then altered,
    just like LilyPond handles this.
* Temporarily removed feature:
  - MusicXML export has been temporarily removed from the File->Export menu. 
    It is still visible in the git checkout. It is also available in the ly 
    command (in the python-ly package, and also in Frescobaldi's git checkout) 
    but it needs more testing and robustness before it is usable in Frescobaldi.


Changes in 2.0.13 -- December 31st, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr
* New features:
  - A new option LilyPond->Auto-engrave, that runs the engraver in preview mode
    everytime the document changes
  - An option to hide log display for automatically started engraving jobs
  - Real-time Midi capturing, contributed by Manuel Mchalwat (this was actually
    in 2.0.12, I just forgot to write it in the ChangeLog!)
  - Basic MusicXML export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr (this was also already
    added in Frescobaldi 2.0.12)
  - The "master" variable is back, allbeit in a slightly different
    implementation: the redirected filename is not directly given to a LilyPond
    process running on behalf of the current document, but the other document
    is loaded (if it wasn't already) and LilyPond is run on that document.
* Bug fixes:
  - Fix UnboundLocalError in ly.docinfo e.g. when showing the Tools->Pitch->
    Language menu
  - Fix issue 332: Cursor didn't move on undo/redo
  - Fix issue 315: chords: \include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
    (the file was added, but the include files weren't written in the document)


Changes in 2.0.12 -- December 26th, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: cs, nl, fr, es
* New features:
  - Edit->Select Block has finally been implemented
  - A viewer for LilyPond-generated SVG files has been added by Peter Bjuhr. 
    This viewer (accessible via Tools->SVG Viewer) currently has one-way point 
    and click. This only works with recent development versions of LilyPond, 
    that add the point and click information to SVG files. In the future, the
    SVG view may become a fully fledged graphical music editor.
  - The default output format can be set in the LilyPond preferences (the 
    current options are PDF or SVG, the default is PDF)
* Improvements:
  - The indenter's handling of tabs and spaces has been improved. A tab always
    starts a new indent level, and aligning is now always done with spaces.
    The default is still using 2 spaces for indent, but it is now configurable
    in a new settings panel Editor Preferences.
  - Besides the good old Preview and Publish modes a new mode has been added:
    Layout Control. This mode uses the settings on the preview mode panel, which
    has been renamed to Layout Control Options. The layout of the panel has been
    improved. The Preview mode is reverted back to enabling only point and click
    links. In the Engrave (custom) dialog the run mode can be chosen and the
    commandline edited directly.
  - Entering staccatissimo writes -! when the document specifies a LilyPond
    version >= 2.17.25, otherwise -|
  - When editing keyboard shortcuts, conflicts are directly shown as they are
    entered; better support French keyboards (contributed by Nicolas Malarmey)
  - Better Mac OS X icons (contributed by Davide Liessi)
  - The internal handling of manipulations like transpose, translate, and the
    various rhythm commands has become less dependent on Frescobaldi code.
    These functionality now resides in the ly module and could be used by 
    other applications. The commands now can work on any ly.document, which 
    need not be a Frescobaldi document.
  - The internal help system has seen a massive overhaul: help files are now
    very easy to write in a simplified markdown-like syntax. Adding help pages
    is very easy by dropping a *.md file in the userguide/ directory. Every
    paragraph in a help file is automatically added to the POT file and can be
    translated by editing the language's PO file.
* Bug fixes:
  - Music View: horizontal scrolling using trackpad now works with kinetic mode
    enabled. Fixes #248.
* Removed feature:
  - The 'master' variable is no longer supported, it's goal has been superseded
    by the 'Always Engrave' option, which is also saved in the session. This
    decision was taken to simplify the handling of files created on behalf of
    a document.


Changes in 2.0.11 -- October 16th, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: cs, nl, fr, es

    contributed by Nicolas Malarmey.
  - New Modal Transpose action, contributed by Christopher Bryan
  - New actions to remove articulations etc. from music (wish #180)
  - Edit->Copy to Snippet, to copy the selection or the full document
    contents to a new snippet
* Improvements:
  - highlighting and auto-completion of Scheme code has been improved
    by Nicolas Malarmey. 
  - when switching documents with multiple editor views open, and one of the
    views displays the document, that view is made current, instead of changing
    the document in the current view.
  - the tempo-tapping button in the score wizard now uses the average clicking
    speed instead of computing the bpm at each click (implementing wish #169)
  - under the File menu there is also a New with Wizard... action calling the
    score wizard, creating a new document when clicking Ok, contributed by Urs
    Liska
  - Word-related cursor movements have been improved. The backslash is now
    considered a word boundary, even if there are no spaces between several
    backslashed commands. Fixes wish #106.
* Bug fixes:
  - various fixes and improvements on Mac OS X by Davide Liessi
  - fix splash screen shown as grey rectangle on some systems
  - in the LilyPond log, clicking on error mesages in files with '..' in their
    path (happens when using e.g. \include "../blabla.ly") now works.

  - New actions View->Matching Pair and Select Matching Pair to jump to or

    take a long time anymore when editing or moving through a long document

  - Export colored HTML now uses CSS classes, makes it easy to change the high-
    lighting in the HTML later (idea: issue #89)

  - Fix hyphenation of words with accents (reported by Andreas Edlund)
  - Fix Save As... on Mac OS X (issue #104)
