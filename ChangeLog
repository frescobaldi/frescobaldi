Changes in 2.18 -- March 7th, 2015

* Important notes about installing and for packagers/distributors:
  - Frescobaldi is now dependent on the package 'python-ly'. This package
    needs to be installed so that Frescobaldi can run.
    It is listed among the dependencies in the INSTALL file and it can be found
    at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ly.
    Previously, this python package was contained in the frescobaldi_app folder.
    So, when overwriting previous Frescobaldi installations, be sure that any
    remnants from the old 'ly' package are removed, with a command like:
        rm -r /usr/local/<python site-packagesdir>/frescobaldi_app/ly
    Otherwise, Frescobaldi won't find the new ly module and will fail to run.
    Python-ly version 0.9 is required for Frescobaldi 2.18.
  - Python 3.2 (or higher) is supported and recommended! But Python 2.7 will
    continue to be supported during the full Frescobaldi 2 lifecycle.
* New features:
  - Midi import, using the LilyPond-provided midi2ly tool
  - ABC import, using the LilyPond-provided abc2ly tool
  - In the Editor Preferences, you can select which quotes will be used as
    single and double (primary and secondary) typographical quotes (issue #529)
  - The music view now can display a PDF document with two pages next to each
    other, starting with a right or left page, and in single pages (issue #575)
  - A new pitch tool, Mode shift, which can be used to change all or selected
    notes to a specified mode or scale.
  - Commands to convert rests to spaces or vice versa, and to convert pitched
    rests (like c'4\rest) to normal rests, contributed by Peter Bjuhr.
  - Command to open LilyPond data directory (useful if you want to study Lily's
    own init- and Scheme files).
* Improvements:
  - The Insert menu got renamed to Snippets, making more clear how it is used
    and can be changed. When copying text to a new snippet, the snippet is added
    to the menu by default, but the user can change that while editing.
  - Ctrl+Break (LilyPond → Abort Engraving Job) also stops an autocompile job
    if one is running.
  - The SVG View now displays a default gray background when no document is
    loaded, which is more helpful than a white background.
  - When right-clicking in the editor, the editor does not scroll anymore to
    show more surrounding lines.
  - Multi-line block comments are now also foldable (issue #587)
  - The magnifying glass in the Music View does not clip to the page borders
    anymore, which was annoying when showing many pages in a small size.
  - To save space in the toolbar, the almost never used Save As... button was
    removed. But when holding the Save button longer, three choices pop up:
    Save, Save As and Save All.
  - Ctrl-Mousewheel zooming the LilyPond Log now works properly.
* Bugfixes:
  - The german ("deutsch") pitch names asas and heses are now handled correctly.
    Previously, when translating the "nederlands" beses to german, it was output
    as bes, instead of heses. Same for "norsk" and "suomi" (issue #415)
  - If the preference "Open default viewer after successful compile" is enabled,
    the viewer to be opened is determined from the actual results, instead of
    the default output format. This fixes the PDF view opening instead of the
    SVG view, when the SVG format was chosen in the Engrave Custom dialog.
  - fix AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'insert' (issue #543)
  - the transpose functions will not transpose the chord after \stringTuning
    anymore (issue #539).
  - fix error when opening a "recent file" that has been deleted (issue #597)
  - Quick Insert articulations etc. now also work with q (repeated) chords
    (issue #628, fixed in python-ly)
  - Quick Insert: do not add articulation to the duration of a \tuplet command
    (issue #631, fixed in python-ly)
* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr, ru, it

* New features:
  - Preference for the number of contextual lines to show at least, when the
    text view is scrolled to a cursor position (e.g. by clicking on a link, or
    when jumping between search results. Wish: issue #488)
  - Session import/export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr
  - A session can have its own list of include paths, that can be used either
    instead of or in addition to the global list of include paths, contributed
    by Peter Bjuhr
  - Relative mode for MIDI input, contributed by Alex Schreiber (pull request
    #521)
* Improvements:
  - When saving a new file for the first time, a default filename is provided,
    based on composer and title of the score (wish: issue #472)
  - Printing the music PDF now honors the duplex settings
  - MusicXML export has improved by using the ly.music module that has a notion
    of the music events and time/duration of those events. Although ly.music is
    authored and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen, the MusicXML export module is
    contributed by Peter Bjuhr
  - workaround a LilyPond buglet in point-and-click highlighting of quoted
    strings: although the textedit uri points to the closing quote, the string
    is correctly highlighted
  - don't disable run button of Engrave Custom dialog for autocompile jobs
  - let autocompile jobs finish before starting a new one (comments issue #120)
  - don't always run autocompile job for the first opened document
  - after a successful compile the default music viewer (pdf or svg) is
    activated. This can be suppressed in the LilyPond prefs (wish: issue #435)
  - the music view does not switch documents anymore when a compile is finished
    but the user is working on a different document (wish: issue #513)
  - tooltips for the panel title and float/close buttons
  - error handling in I/O-related operations has improved
  - Ctrl+C in editor view does not copy HTML, only plain text (issue #517)
  - Features that are in development can be enabled by checking Preferences→
    General→Experimental Features→Enable Experimental Features. Some features
    that are not completely finished are hidden by default but become visible
    when this preference is enabled. New features are enabled after a restart,
    or when a new main window is created using Window→New.
* Bugfixes:
  - fix AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'endswith' in
    lilypondinfo.py, toolcommand()
  - fix AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_register_cursor'
    (cause in music.py, get_included_document_node())
* Installation:
  - Python 2.7 is now required.
* Translations:
  - updated: nl, pt_BR, fr, it, de
  - new (partial): Chinese Traditional, Simplified and Hong Kong by Anthony Fok


Changes in 2.0.16 -- June 9th, 2014

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr, it
* New features
  - preference to automatically strip trailing whitespace on save (issue #274)
  - in Tools -> Rhythm: new command to remove duration scalings that contain
    a fraction value (the action was already available for some time, but it
    wasn't in the menu)
  - new option to copy only the styled HTML contents to the clipboard
    wrapped in a pre tag, not a full HTML document
* Improvements:

  - autocompile does only happen when a document has toplevel markup or music
  - LilyPond instance can be selected in convert-ly dialog (wish #311)
  - Score Wizard: In the midi section the \tempo x=y syntax is now used when

  - Score Wizard: new brass instruments contributed by Ryan Michael McClure
  - in the builtin manual, if there is no "Next:" page, add a link to the next
    page of the first parent page that has a next page. The link is called
    "Next Chapter:" and allows for continuous reading of the manual.
  - some missing commands and functions were added to highlighting and
    autocompletion
  - the Document Fonts snippet doesn't require setting the staff size anymore
  - View -> Folding -> Fold all now folds all subregions as well, making
    gradual unfolding easier (wish #394)
* Bugfixes:
  - fix sticky document setting lost on reload (issue #409)
  - fix html export and copy not using the correct color scheme
  - fix AttributeError in handle_lyricmode while typing \lyricmode

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr

    scrolling (wish #45)
  - Custom engrave: the anti-alias-factor can be set in the dialog (wish #361)
  - on Mac OS X the applications remains active when all main windows are
    closed. This is expected behaviour on Mac OS X.
  - New builtin snippet, linked to Ctrl+D by default, to double the current
    line or selection (issue #340)
  - A new preference for new documents: whether a new document is created empty,
    with the preferred LilyPond version in it, or using a template from the
    snippets list
  - New menu command: LilyPond->Show available fonts (wish #341)
  - Music View: rendering in small sizes has been improved
* Improvements:
  - In the score wizard it is possible to enter a custom string tuning for the
    plucked string instruments, and the Ukulele is added (issue #342)
  - In the score wizard you can enable Smart neutral stem direction, which adds
    the Melody_engraver to the Voice context, resulting in a logical direction
    for notes on the middle staff line (issue #371)
  - Print source, Copy colored HTML and Export source as colored HTML: add line
    numbers if enabled in the preferences.
  - In the Editor preferences, it is adjustable whether HTML export or copy use
    a stylesheet or inline style attributes.
  - It is now possible to copy syntax-highlighted HTML as plain text to the
    clipboard, by enabling the preference setting.
  - MIDI input: add key signature alterations mapping, by Olivier Samyn
  - New barline types in the Quick Insert panel, the barlines are written
    in the correct style, depending on the LilyPond version set in the document
    (issue #365).
  - In the output-suffix (the scheme output-suffix variable or
    \bookOutputSuffix), non-alphanumeric characters (except '-' and '_') are
    replaced with '_', just like LilyPond itself does it (issue #373).
* Bug fixes:
  - Fixed issue 336: TypeError on MusicXml export
  - Fixed error message when exporting keyboard shortcuts on platforms that do
    not have the HOME environment variable set
  - Fixed IndexError when transposed notes would get unexisting alterations,
    e.g. when a cis is transposed from c to cisis. The note is then altered,
    just like LilyPond handles this.
* Temporarily removed feature:
  - MusicXML export has been temporarily removed from the File->Export menu.
    It is still visible in the git checkout. It is also available in the ly
    command (in the python-ly package, and also in Frescobaldi's git checkout)
    but it needs more testing and robustness before it is usable in Frescobaldi.


Changes in 2.0.13 -- December 31st, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, fr
* New features:
  - A new option LilyPond->Auto-engrave, that runs the engraver in preview mode
    every time the document changes
  - An option to hide log display for automatically started engraving jobs
  - Real-time Midi capturing, contributed by Manuel Mchalwat (this was actually
    in 2.0.12, I just forgot to write it in the ChangeLog!)
  - Basic MusicXML export, contributed by Peter Bjuhr (this was also already
    added in Frescobaldi 2.0.12)
  - The "master" variable is back, allbeit in a slightly different
    implementation: the redirected filename is not directly given to a LilyPond
    process running on behalf of the current document, but the other document
    is loaded (if it wasn't already) and LilyPond is run on that document.
* Bug fixes:
  - Fix UnboundLocalError in ly.docinfo e.g. when showing the Tools->Pitch->
    Language menu
  - Fix issue 332: Cursor didn't move on undo/redo
  - Fix issue 315: chords: \include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
    (the file was added, but the include files weren't written in the document)


Changes in 2.0.12 -- December 26th, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: cs, nl, fr, es
* New features:
  - Edit->Select Block has finally been implemented
  - A viewer for LilyPond-generated SVG files has been added by Peter Bjuhr.
    This viewer (accessible via Tools->SVG Viewer) currently has one-way point
    and click. This only works with recent development versions of LilyPond,
    that add the point and click information to SVG files. In the future, the
    SVG view may become a fully fledged graphical music editor.
  - The default output format can be set in the LilyPond preferences (the
    current options are PDF or SVG, the default is PDF)
* Improvements:
  - The indenter's handling of tabs and spaces has been improved. A tab always
    starts a new indent level, and aligning is now always done with spaces.
    The default is still using 2 spaces for indent, but it is now configurable
    in a new settings panel Editor Preferences.
  - Besides the good old Preview and Publish modes a new mode has been added:
    Layout Control. This mode uses the settings on the preview mode panel, which
    has been renamed to Layout Control Options. The layout of the panel has been
    improved. The Preview mode is reverted back to enabling only point and click
    links. In the Engrave (custom) dialog the run mode can be chosen and the
    commandline edited directly.
  - Entering staccatissimo writes -! when the document specifies a LilyPond
    version >= 2.17.25, otherwise -|
  - When editing keyboard shortcuts, conflicts are directly shown as they are
    entered; better support French keyboards (contributed by Nicolas Malarmey)
  - Better Mac OS X icons (contributed by Davide Liessi)
  - The internal handling of manipulations like transpose, translate, and the
    various rhythm commands has become less dependent on Frescobaldi code.
    These functionality now resides in the ly module and could be used by
    other applications. The commands now can work on any ly.document, which
    need not be a Frescobaldi document.
  - The internal help system has seen a massive overhaul: help files are now
    very easy to write in a simplified markdown-like syntax. Adding help pages
    is very easy by dropping a *.md file in the userguide/ directory. Every
    paragraph in a help file is automatically added to the POT file and can be
    translated by editing the language's PO file.
* Bug fixes:
  - Music View: horizontal scrolling using trackpad now works with kinetic mode
    enabled. Fixes #248.
* Removed feature:
  - The 'master' variable is no longer supported, it's goal has been superseded
    by the 'Always Engrave' option, which is also saved in the session. This
    decision was taken to simplify the handling of files created on behalf of
    a document.


Changes in 2.0.11 -- October 16th, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: cs, nl, fr, es

    contributed by Nicolas Malarmey.
  - New Modal Transpose action, contributed by Christopher Bryan
  - New actions to remove articulations etc. from music (wish #180)
  - Edit->Copy to Snippet, to copy the selection or the full document
    contents to a new snippet
* Improvements:
  - highlighting and auto-completion of Scheme code has been improved
    by Nicolas Malarmey.
  - when switching documents with multiple editor views open, and one of the
    views displays the document, that view is made current, instead of changing
    the document in the current view.
  - the tempo-tapping button in the score wizard now uses the average clicking
    speed instead of computing the bpm at each click (implementing wish #169)
  - under the File menu there is also a New with Wizard... action calling the
    score wizard, creating a new document when clicking Ok, contributed by Urs
    Liska
  - Word-related cursor movements have been improved. The backslash is now
    considered a word boundary, even if there are no spaces between several
    backslashed commands. Fixes wish #106.
* Bug fixes:
  - various fixes and improvements on Mac OS X by Davide Liessi
  - fix splash screen shown as grey rectangle on some systems
  - in the LilyPond log, clicking on error mesages in files with '..' in their
    path (happens when using e.g. \include "../blabla.ly") now works.

Changes in 2.0.9 -- March 23rd, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, de, uk
* New features:
  - Frescobaldi now detects when other applications modify or delete open files
    and displays the changes in a dialog, where the user can reload or save the
    affected documents. The file-watching is turned on by default, but can be
    disabled. (wish: issue #103)
  - File->Reload and Reload All: reload the current document or all documents
    from disk. This action can be undone with Ctrl-Z.
  - Frescobaldi now can be configured to open the generated PDF files when
    opening a LilyPond document, even if they are not up-to-date. It then shows
    a red background in the document chooser. See Preferences->Tools->Music View
  - Music->Reload: switches the Music View to the current source document and
    re-checks for updated PDF documents. If there are no updated PDFs it even
    tries to load non up-to-date PDFs (regardless of the setting above)
  - New --list-sessions commandline option to list the named sessions
  - New actions View->Matching Pair and Select Matching Pair to jump to or
    select the range of matching parentheses, braces etc (wish: issue #105)
  - Quick Insert: \melisma, \melismaEnd spanner button (idea: issue #88)
* Improvements:
  - Custom defined markup commands are also auto-completed
  - Better default font on Windows
  - Action "Always Engrave this document" also available in document context
    menu (in documents list and in tabbar)
  - Don't check included files multiple times for defined commands etc.
  - Highlighting matching characters, such as slur, brace, << >>, etc does not
    take a long time anymore when editing or moving through a long document
  - string numbers are highlighted (and understood) correctly outside chords
    (LilyPond 2.16 syntax change)
  - Export colored HTML now uses CSS classes, makes it easy to change the high-
    lighting in the HTML later (idea: issue #89)
* Bug fixes:
  - Fix hyphenation of words with accents (reported by Andreas Edlund)
  - Fix Save As... on Mac OS X (issue #104)
  - Fix startup failure on Mac OS X (issue #77)
  - Fix QPyNullVariant error messages with some PyQt versions

    durations, except for the first duration in a line.
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - New default shortcuts for Slur: Ctrl+( and Breathing sign: Alt+'

    created or updated PDF documents. As a result, the 'Disable PDF preview'
    setting became superfluous and has been removed.
* LilyPond Log:
  - The toolbar at the bottom has been removed, as all functions in the main

* General:
  - Tabs can be reordered (can be turned off)
  - Tabs don't get automatic shortcuts, they sometimes conflict with ours
  - the right tool dock has been made slightly larger by default
* New: Session Management, in two ways:
  - Basic session management: if you log out with Frescobaldi running and then
    back in, Frescobaldi will reopen the documents that were open at logout.
  - Advanced named session support. A session defines a list of open documents,
    and optionally a base directory. More features will be added later to be
    able to use this as a light-weight project tool.
* Context sensitive LilyPond help:
  - added support for internals reference: contexts, grobs and engravers
* Bugfixes:
  - Fix crash when editing toolbars
* Installation:
  - A 'run' script has been added to run Frescobaldi from the tarball (or even
    SVN) without installing.
  - Using CMake out-of-source is now easier: icons and translations are not
    rebuilt anymore so the Frescobaldi install procedure does not need LilyPond
    and 'convert' (from ImageMagick) anymore. The icons and translations are in
    the prebuilt/ directory. Simply removing this directory restores the old
    behaviour (useful when you want to develop Frescobaldi from a release
    tarball, although a fresh SVN checkout is recommended in that case).
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
  - Turkish updated by Server Acim


Changes in 1.1.2 -- July 8th, 2010

* New features:
  - Segno bar line added (available in LilyPond 2.13.19 and higher)
  - It is now possible to configure the path that is used to find
    files that are included via the LilyPond \include command.
  - New 'Close other' action to close all documents except the current
  - Print and View icons in the toolbar to print music and open PDF and MIDI
    files in their external helper applications
* Printing:
  - Printing generated PDF files now uses a print dialog, instead of just
    sending the PDF to the 'lpr' command.
* Run LilyPond:
  - warn if the document contains a conflicting point and click setting
* General:
  - print and email actions have moved to the File menu
  - close button on document tabs (can be turned off in Settings->Editor Comp.)
  - warnings and notifications have a "don't ask again" checkbox, and can be
    turned back on in the settings
  - progress indicator saves the build time in document metainfo
* Autocompletion:
  - only popup completions from the expansion manager on blank lines
* Settings dialog:
  - the settings have been organized in more logical groups
* Installation:
  - building the icons from SVN or out-of-source requires LilyPond >= 2.13.19
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
  - French updated by Valentin Villenave
  - Italian updated by Gianluca D'Orazio


Changes in 1.1.1 -- May 3rd, 2010

  - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
  - Turkish updated by Server Acim


Changes in 1.1.0 -- March 26th, 2010

* It is now possible to use multiple versions of LilyPond easily from within
  Frescobaldi. LilyPond instances can be configured under Settings, Paths.
  There is also a custom Run LilyPond command where a version can be chosen,
  among other options.  And Frescobaldi can be configured to automatically
  choose a LilyPond version according to the document's \version statement.
* Score Wizard, Choir:
  - New lyric option "Distribute stanzas" to spread the stanzas between staves.
    This option only has effect when there are three or more staves, and is very
    useful if there is a large number of stanzas that apply to all voices.
  - Lyric placement is fine-tuned when LilyPond >= 2.13.4 is used, using the
    staff-affinity setting, so lyrics are placed close to the staff they belong
    to. If lyrics apply to multiple voices, the are centered between staves.
    This improves the layout of vocal music if the systems are vertically
    streched by LilyPond to fill the page nicely.
  - New checkbox to create rehearsal MIDI files. If checked, one MIDI file is
    generated for each voice, with the voice standing out in a clear sound and
    the other voices in a lower volume. Repeats are unfolded and lyrics for the
    current voice are also added to the MIDI file.
* Score Wizard, Score settings:
  - New checkbox option to wrap the score in a \book block.
* New dialog to insert special characters from the Unicode table, with the
  ability to assign keyboard shortcuts to often used characters.
* New command: Copy Lyrics with hyphenation removed
* Expansion Dialog:
  - has now some documented default keyboard shortcuts
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - New buttons for \halfopen and \snappizzicato
  - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to the articulation buttons
* Repeat last expression: don't append space
* Email files: select files with checkboxes instead of Ctrl+Click
* Installation:
  - byte compiling the Python modules can be suppressed by adding
    -DBYTECOMPILE=NO to the cmake command line
  - building the icons from SVN or out-of-source requires LilyPond 2.13.11+
* Some workarounds for subtle SIP 4.10/KDE 4.4 garbage collection bugs


Changes in 1.0.2 -- February 18th, 2010

* Make Frescobaldi working with SIP 4.10 and KDE 4.4


Changes in 1.0.1 -- January 17th, 2010

* Translations:
  - New Galician translation by Manuel A. Vázquez
* Bugfixes:
  - Rumor: Make config dialog more robust if no MIDI outputs available
  - Score Wizard: Fix disappearing instrumentName if this is a markup object and
    the same one as shortInstrumentName
  - Stability improvements
  - Some corrections in the default expansions of the Expansion Manager


Changes in 1.0.0 -- December 26th, 2009

* Editor:
  - Right-click menu action on \include command now opens the named file from
    the LilyPond data directory if that exists and there is no local file with
    that name.
* Repeat last expression (Ctrl+;):
  - Doesn't repeat normal rests and skips, but rather the chord preceding it
  - Keeps the \rest when repeating a pitched rest (e.g. c\rest)
  - Only removes the octave from the repeated pitch (or from the first pitch
    of the repeated chord) inside \relative music expressions
* Blank staff paper tool:
  - option to remove small "FRESCOBALDI.ORG" tagline at bottom
* Score Wizard:
  - Fix lyrics not added if there is only one staff (reported by M. Moles)
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - If cursor is inside a chord, note or rest, the cursor is positioned right
    after the chord, note or rest before the articulation is inserted (if there
    is no selection, in which case the articulation is inserted after all
    chords, notes or rests). So now you can click a note in the PDF and directly
    click a button to add an articulation or ornament etc. without repositioning
    the cursor manually.
* PDF preview:
  - Action in contextmenu to reload PDF document
* General:
  - Fix crash on moving tools around
  - Fix crash on exit on some systems with multiple updated documents open
  - Work around crash on logging out from the built-in terminal and then hiding
    and re-showing it, that occurs due to a bug in SIP 4.9.1
  - ESC key now closes PDF-preview dialogs properly
  - ESC key does not take focus away from editor window if PDF visible
  - Main window is activated when clicking on notes in detached PDF viewer
  - Fix interaction with SIP 4.9.3 (some settings were not saved, like paths)
  - Fix order of cautionary accidentals and octave marks in pitches (affects
    transpose and relative/absolute conversion functions)
  - Fix attribute error on file dialogs in KDE 4.1 (but KDE 4.2 is recommended)
  - Fix document name not shown in tab bar if opening non-existing file
  - Improved hyphenation dictionaries search, also some explanation in docs
* Installation:
  - CMake now does not require a compiler to be present anymore
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by Wilbert Berendsen
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
  - Turkish updated by S. Acim
  - Italian updated by Gianluca D'Orazio
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
  - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
  - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
  - German updated by Georg Hennig


Changes in 0.7.17 -- November 29th, 2009

* Expansion Dialog:
  - It is now possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to snippets in the dialog
  - Improved syntax coloring in snippet entry
* Autocompletion:
  - If the autocompleter does not find any suitable completions, matching
    expansions from the Expansion dialog are shown
* Score Wizard:
  - Harp, Guitar and Jazz Guitar: allow multiple voices per staff
  - Choir: checkbox for automatic piano reduction
* General bugfixes and improvements:
  - When quitting, the last seen documents, starting with the current, are
    closed first. This way, if the user cancels the quit, the current document
    (if modified) remains the same.
  - Files can be opened by dropping them on the Frescobaldi window
  - Fix crash when swichting to a document opened using the Open File dialog
    when multiple files were opened at the same time
  - All pitch manipulation functions better detect the end of unbracketed markup
    expressions like: g g g-\markup \sharp g g g.  Frescobaldi now knows the
    number of arguments each markup command has and will not mistake the g after
    \sharp for a markup argument.
* Installation:
  - building and installing the User Guide has been improved. If meinproc4 or
    the XSL stylesheets can't be found, only a warning is printed and the cache
    file (index.cache.bz2) is not pre-generated, but the install will continue.
    (If there is no cache file, KHelpcenter will generate one on a per-user
    basis as soon as the User Guide is displayed for the first time.)
* Translations:
  - Dutch updated by me
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila
  - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski
  - Czech updated by Pavel Fric
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh


Changes in 0.7.16 -- November 15th, 2009

* New command to transpose music
* New commands for conversion between relative and absolute pitches
* New: Alt+Shift+Up/Down selects text till next or previous blank line, and
  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up/Down moves the selected block to the next or previous blank
  line. This gives a very quick way to reorder fragments of LilyPond input.
* A new tool to create empty staff paper
* Improved support for quarter tones in all pitch-related functions
* Translations:
  - French updated by Ryan Kavanagh
  - Spanish updated by Francisco Vila


Changes in 0.7.15 -- October 13th, 2009

* New LilyPond documentation browser providing context-sensitive help
* New shortcuts:
  - Repeat selected music, Ctrl+Shift+R: wraps the selection in a
    \repeat volta 2 { music... } construct
  - Insert pair of braces, Ctrl+{: wraps the selection in braces, or inserts
    { newline newline } and places the cursor on the middle indented line.
* New bar lines submenu to insert different types of bar lines
* Expansion Manager:
  - Two cursormarks (|) can be used to select a range of text after expanding
  - New contextmenu command to add selected text to expansions
* Autocompletion:
  - named colors are shown in the right color
  - some often used block commands like \header now also insert the braces,
    and place the cursor between them.
  - names of variables (like composer in the header) automagically append ' = '
    if the remainder of the line does not start with the '=' character.
* New commands in the Log context menu to copy or save its contents.
* LilyPond symbol icons are displayed white if the users color palette settings
  have light text on a dark background. The icons are automatically recolored
  if the user changes the color preferences while Frescobaldi is running.
* The Save As... dialog now really opens in the default directory if the
  document has no filename yet.
* Tools can be shown/hidden with configurable keyboard shortcuts
* Score Wizard: parts can be reordered by dragging with the mouse
* Documentation updates
* Translations:
  - Turkish updated by S. Acim
  - Russian updated by Artem Zolochevskiy
  - Polish updated by Piotr Komorowski

* Translations:
  - Turkish updated by S. Acim
  - Russian updated by S. Poltavski


Changes in 0.7.12 -- July 1st, 2009

* It is now possible to run LilyPond on remote documents and documents that have
  not been saved yet. In such cases Frescobaldi internally saves the LilyPond
  file to a local temporary directory. Point and click also works on remote or
  unnamed documents. This makes it easy to paste something from an email and run
  LilyPond immediately, without bothering to save it first under a suitable file
  name. The local cache is deleted when the document is closed or saved to a
  directory on the local file system.
* It is now possible to configure external applications for PDF and MIDI files.
  These will then be used instead of the KDE default configured applications.
* New align action (LilyPond->Source Document->Indent) that properly indents a
  document or selection of lines. This indenter is a bit more robust than the
  one built into KatePart. The Score Wizard and Expand Manager now also use the
  users indentation settings, instead of always using two spaces indent.
* New shortcuts to insert nice typographical quotes: Ctrl+' for single and
  Ctrl+" for double quotes. Left and right quotes are automatically determined.
  If text is selected, the selected text is put between quotes.
* Repeat last note/chord: only keep articulations and ties.
* Bug fixes:
  - Smart Point and Click remains working if pitches are translated
  - Text editor keeps keyboard focus again when clicked in PDF preview
  - Rumor plugin more stable in keyboard mode and stops cleanly if running on
    Frescobaldi exit
* Translations:
  - French updated by David Bouriaud (thanks!)
  - Dutch updated by self


Changes in 0.7.11 -- June 15th, 2009

* Stability improvements


Changes in 0.7.10 -- June 9th, 2009

* Point and click: Shift-click in the PDF preview now selects music from current
  cursor position to new cursor position. So you can select a music fragment by
  clicking on the first note and then shift-clicking on the last note.
* Editor:
  - Context sensitive context (right-click) menu with, besides the usual cut,
    copy and paste, commands to open \include file, hyphenate lyrics and
    Cut & Assign text (if selected)
  - The Cut & Assign command (Ctrl+Shift+C) now obeys inputmodes. If you e.g.
    cut out some lyrics, the fragment will automatically be wrapped in a
    \lyricmode { } block.
  - Autocompletion for accidental styles
* User Interface:
  - new document tab bar for easy navigation between open files, can be hidden
  - when running LilyPond and the option 'Save document when LilyPond is run' is
    enabled, the Save As dialog is displayed when the document has no filename
    yet.
* Translations:
  - German translation updated by Georg Hennig (thanks!)


Changes in 0.7.9 -- May 23rd, 2009

* Bugfixes:
  - spurious crashes seem to have been gone (by using thread locks on
    katepart's SmartInterface)
* Editing:
  - Alt-Up and Alt-Down now jump to the first line of a blank block instead of
    just the next or previous blank line.
* Quick Insert Panel:
  - ornaments use the default window text color
* Repeat last expression:
  - remove octave mark from first pitch
  - remove barcheck pipe symbols
* Score Wizard:
  - Small fixes to fretted instruments
  - Predefined Guitar Fret option for Chord Names (also in Lead Sheet)


Changes in 0.7.8 -- March 20th, 2009

* New Polish translation by Piotr Komorowski, many thanks!

  changed without re-running LilyPond. Also the clickable messages in the log.
  Smart Point & Click from the PDF preview only works in KDE 4.2.
* New option to only show the log if LilyPond outputs warnings or errors
* Progress bar in statusbar shows LilyPond progress
* Bugfixes:
  * Make Frescobaldi exit gracefully if a LilyPond job was still running

    were complicated markups in the document.

* PDF preview: context menu has a new action to configure Okular
* Score Wizard: if there is more than one part, make separate assignments for
  the parts. This simplifies the generated \score { } section and makes it
  easier to create additional score sections for printing separate parts.

  * Apply/paste rhythm: don't lose parts of text and don't hang if no rhythm
  * Find translations when installed to non-standard directory
