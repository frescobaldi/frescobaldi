    speed instead of computing the bpm at each click (implementing wish #169)

* New features:
  - Frescobaldi now detects when other applications modify or delete open files

    affected documents. The file-watching is turned on by default, but can be
    disabled. (wish: issue #103)
  - File->Reload and Reload All: reload the current document or all documents
    from disk. This action can be undone with Ctrl-Z.

    opening a LilyPond document, even if they are not up-to-date. It then shows
    a red background in the document chooser. See Preferences->Tools->Music View

    take a long time anymore when editing or moving through a long document
  - string numbers are highlighted (and understood) correctly outside chords

    lighting in the HTML later (idea: issue #89)
