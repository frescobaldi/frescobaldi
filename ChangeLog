Changes in 2.0.9 -- March 23rd, 2013

* Translations:
  - updated: nl, de, uk
* New features:
  - Frescobaldi now detects when other applications modify or delete open files
    and displays the changes in a dialog, where the user can reload or save the
    affected documents. The file-watching is turned on by default, but can be
    disabled. (wish: issue #103)
  - File->Reload and Reload All: reload the current document or all documents
    from disk. This action can be undone with Ctrl-Z.
  - Frescobaldi now can be configured to open the generated PDF files when
    opening a LilyPond document, even if they are not up-to-date. It then shows
    a red background in the document chooser. See Preferences->Tools->Music View

    re-checks for updated PDF documents. If there are no updated PDFs it even
    tries to load non up-to-date PDFs (regardless of the setting above)

    take a long time anymore when editing or moving through a long document
