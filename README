Frescobaldi is designed to run on all major operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X
and MS Windows). It is named after Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643), an Italian
composer of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque period.

Here is an idea of the basic Frescobaldi workflow:

- Start Frescobaldi
- Open a .ly file or create one using File->New from template or Tools->Setup
  new Score... and fill in some music
- Press Ctrl+M to run LilyPond
- If the LilyPond output shows errors, press Ctrl+E to jump to the first error
- If you see other mistakes in the music, click the notes to move the text
  cursor there
- Fix the errors or mistakes in the text
- Press Ctrl+M again to update the music view
- When a piece is finished, press Ctrl+Shift+P once to run LilyPond with point
  and click turned off (this results in a much smaller PDF file).

Frescobaldi is written in Python and uses PyQt4 for its user interface.
See the INSTALL file for other requirements and installation instructions.
