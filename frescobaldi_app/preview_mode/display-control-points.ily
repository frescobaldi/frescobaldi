  snippet-title = "Displaying control points of slurs and ties"
  snippet-author = "David Nalesnik, Thomas Morley, Urs Liska, Janek Warcho≈Ç"
  snippet-description = \markup {
    Slurs, Ties and other similar objects are drawn in LilyPond as
    third-order Bezier curves, which means that their shape is controlled
    by four "control-points" (first and last ones tell where the curve ends
    are placed, and the middle ones affect the curvature).  Changing the
    shape of these objects involves moving these control-points around,
    and it's helpful to see where they actually are.  This snippet defines
    a "\displayControlPoints" function that displays them.  You can use it
    by calling it inside your music expression, or by placing it in
    "\layout" block.  When used inside music expressions, it can be prefixed
    with "\once" in order to display only the control points of the curve that
    starts at this moment.
  }
  % add comma-separated tags to make searching more effective:
  tags = "slur, tie, bezier curve, control point, preview mode"
  % is this snippet ready?  See meta/status-values.md
  status = "ready" % aiming for status "official"
  %{
    NOTE:
    - Workaround for Tie formatting in 2.17 applied:
      \override Tie #'vertical-skylines = #'()
      through the use of 'lilypond-greater-than?' from
      lilypond-version-switch.ly, which has to be present too.
    - Code for printing of 1st/4th CP and line 2nd-3rd CP is
      present but commented out.
