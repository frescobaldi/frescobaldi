    This snippet redefines the commands
    "\voiceOne" to "\voiceFour" so that voices explicitly set
    with them are colored.
    NOTE:
    - When used in conjunction with 'color-directions'
      there may be side-effects.
      In particular the "\oneVoice" and the "\xxxNeutral"
      commands revert the other functions' colors too.
  }
  % add comma-separated tags to make searching more effective:
  tags = "color, preview, frescobaldi"
  % is this snippet ready?  See meta/status-values.md
