%{
  This file is included (through -dinclude-settings)
  by Frescobaldi's Preview compilation mode.
  It checks for the presence of certain command line options
  (which are also inserted by the Preview mode)
  to switch some layout debugging features on or off.
  This design has been chosen to simplify a future
  integration of the functionality into LilyPond proper.
  Then the following code has to be run inside LilyPond
  when a -ddebug-layout command line option is present.

  For an inclusion in LilyPond the strategy has to be modified:
  Currently all options have to be explicitly activated.
  This is because we have the checkbox UI in Frescobaldi.
  When implemented as LilyPond command line option we will
  define a default set of options that is activated by
  -ddebug-layout, while some additional options can be
  activated and the default options be deactivated with
  command line options or #(ly:set-option ...) commands.
