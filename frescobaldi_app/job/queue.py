    An arbitrary number of job.Job() instances (or any descendants)
    can be added to the queue, which are distributed in parallel
    to the runners.

    A special case is a queue with only one runner. This can be used
    to ensure that asynchronous jobs can run in sequence, either to
    ensure that only one such job runs at a time (e.g. to force
    long-running stuff to the background) or to ensure subsequent
    jobs can use the results of earlier ones.

    The queue supports pause(), resume() and abort() operations.
    It iterates through the states

                STARTED

                ABORTED

    A Queue can work in two modes: QueueMode.CONTINUOUS (default) and
    QueueMode.SINGLE. In single mode the queue is considered finished once
    there are no jobs available while a continuous queue switches to
    IDLE in that case. A CONTINUOUS queue is always considered to be
    active (idle when empty) and doesn't have to be explicitly started.

    If a 'capacity' is passed to the queue it has the notion of "full",
    otherwise an unlimited number of jobs can be enqueued.

    By default an internal FIFO (First in, first out) Queue is used
    as the underlying data structure, but Stack and PriorityQueue are
    available through the keyword command as well.
