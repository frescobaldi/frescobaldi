=== Rhythm manipulation ===

The rhythm functions of Frescobaldi alter the durations written after notes,
chords, rests, etcetera. Using those functions, all in menu {menu}, it
is possible to double or halve the length of notes, to add or remove dots
and to remove scaling factors.

Also it is possible to change the way rhythm is specified: for every note
(explicit), or only when the duration changes (implicit). Some users may prefer
the option implicit per line, which always specifies the duration for the first
note, chord or rest on a line.

The last three menu commands can copy, paste or apply a rhythm that is entered
in a dialog.

In the "Apply Rhythm" dialog you can enter a series of durations, e.g.:

```
4. 8 4 16 16 8 2
```

which will then, repetitively, be applied to a selection of notes.
