=== History of Frescobaldi ===

Frescobaldi has its roots in LilyKDE, which was a plugin for KDE3's editor Kate.
LilyKDE was written in Python and released in 2007 on Christmas.

When KDE developed version 4, it was not immediately possible to make Kate
plugins in Python. So LilyKDE became a standalone application, wrapping the
Kate texteditor part, and was renamed to Frescobaldi. It still used the Okular
KDE part to display PDF documents.
Frescobaldi 0.7 was the first public release, on Christmas 2008.
On Christmas 2009 version 1.0.0 was released and on Christmas 2010 version 1.2.0.

At that time it was decided to move away from the KDE4 libraries and just use
Python and Qt4 which are easily available on all major computing platforms.
Frescobaldi 2.0 is a complete rewrite from scratch, and was released at
Christmas 2011.

Frescobaldi 2 had many releases from 2011 to 2017, where lots of functionality
was added and many improvements were made. During these years, more developers
joined initial author and core developer Wilbert Berendsen to work on
Frescobaldi. A great effort was done to port Frescobaldi to Python3 and Qt5,
which brought more stability and durability, and better multilingual support.

In 2017, Frescobaldi was accepted in the *Google Summer Of Code* project,
where a number of students contributed significantly.

In 2019, Frescobaldi and some supporting libraries were moved to the 
`frescobaldi` organisation on GitHub, reflecting that Frescobaldi now really
is a community-supported Free Software project.
