=== History of Frescobaldi ===

Frescobaldi has its roots in LilyKDE, which was a plugin for KDE3's editor Kate.
LilyKDE was written in Python and released in 2007 on Christmas.

When KDE developed version 4, it was not immediately possible to make Kate
plugins in Python. So LilyKDE became a standalone application, wrapping the
Kate texteditor part, and was renamed to Frescobaldi. It still used the Okular
KDE part to display PDF documents.
Frescobaldi 0.7 was the first public release, on Christmas 2008.
On Christmas 2009 version 1.0.0 was released and on Christmas 2010 version 1.2.0.

At that time it was decided to move away from the KDE4 libraries and just use
Python and Qt4 which are easily available on all major computing platforms.
Frescobaldi 2.0 is a complete rewrite from scratch. Its release date is
targeted at Christmas 2011.
