=== General Preferences ===

Under *General Preferences*, you can choose in which language Frescobaldi's 
user interface is translated, which user interface style you want to use, 
and whether you want to use the built-in Tango iconset or to use the 
system-wide configured icon set.

Language and style take effect immediately, but the new iconset is visible
after Frescobaldi has been restarted.

Under *Session to load if Frescobaldi is started without arguments* you can 
configure which session to load if Frescobaldi is started without a 
filename. You can choose whether to start with one empty document, with the 
last used session, or with a specific session. Please note that this only 
works when you have explicitly created a session and set it to automatically 
add files on save to it. See also {sessions}.

Under *When saving documents*, you can choose what to do when a document is 
saved, such as remembering the cursor position and marked lines, or leaving 
a backup copy of the document (with a `~` appended).

Also, you can specify a default folder in which you keep your LilyPond 
documents.

Under *Creating new documents*, you can choose what to do when a new document
is created. It can be left empty (the default), the current LilyPond version
can be set to it, or you can choose any of the templates you defined.
