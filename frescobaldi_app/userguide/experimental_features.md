=== Experimental Features ===

Some features of Frescobaldi are in development for quite some time before
they are considered ready for general use. To be able to take advantage of
those features, knowing their limitations, you can select the option *Enable
Experimental Features*, in the {prefs_general}.

In most cases you need to restart Frescobaldi or create a new window
(via {menu_window_new}) to see the new menu options.

This is the list of experimental features in Frescobaldi:

* {export_audio} Export audio (converts MIDI to WAV)
* {export_musicxml} Convert LilyPond source to MusicXML (without using LilyPond)
* {object_editor} Edit properties of objects in LilyPond output
* Editing items in the SVG view
